    <h4>How much economic potential is locked up by restrictive zoning?</h4>
    <p>A handful of local governments in the Bay Area, New York, and other tech hubs have an inordinate amount of power over
    the modern economy, like deciding how much housing can get built or if a new office building like Apple Park can break ground. Restrictive zoning laws keep rents high, encourage
    sprawl, and make it harder for knowledge to cluster by applying pressure that pushes ambitious people elsewhere. Our
    cities are the engines of economic productivity yet their potential is often dictated by local politics, to which many
    people in technology aren't paying enough attention.</p>

    <h4>How do you create effective institutions?</h4>
    <p>In 2021 I started a DAO that pooled $5m to buy land using a new law in state of Wyoming that made it possible. As a
    decentralized organization, everything is decided through a vote of the members. Compared to my company, each action
    needed much more deliberating and buy-in. While it's indeed a more democratic institution, it also moves slower as a
    result. Startups, which need to move fast, are more akin to dictatorships (hopefully benevolent ones). This allows them
    to make a lot of tiny decisions fast instead of having the team vote on every new feature or design choice. Benevolent
    dictatorships can be effective and fast while they are benevolent, but since they concentrate resources and power, they
    make it tempting for infighting over control and are volatile in periods of regime change. Starting the DAO was a study
    in incentive design and institutions - and made me fascinated by how to build institutions that are effective, enduring,
    and compassionate.
