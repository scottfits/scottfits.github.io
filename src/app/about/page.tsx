          I started my journey by building iPhone apps to help people learn to read music. 
          I then started AirGarage out of a personal pain point of trying to find parking on campus.

          For fun, I write and produce music, help friends think about problems at their startups, 
          and read books.

          My work sits at the intersection of technology, urban planning, and governance. 
          I&apos;m particularly interested in how we can use technology to make cities more 
          livable and accessible for everyone, not just the wealthy.

          Through my experiences with AirGarage and CityDAO, I&apos;ve learned that the biggest 
          challenges in urban development aren&apos;t technical—they&apos;re institutional. 
          How do we align incentives? How do we build systems that are both efficient and equitable? 
          These are the questions that drive my work.
